<h4>TypeScript is an Open Source Object Oriented programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft Corporation.
TypeScript is a strongly typed language and its first version was introduced in 2012. It is a Strict Super Set of JavaScript.</h4>

### `TypeScript ===>>> JavaScript + Type + Some Added Features`

# Advantages

1. Strict typing
Everything stays the way we define it. Need a variable to always be a number? It’ll always be a number, then.

2. Structural typing
Indispensable when you care about fully defining the actual structure you use. JavaScript allows for a lot of strange things to be done, so relying on a specific structure is a much safer solution.

3. Type annotations
A handy way of saying explicitly what type should be used.

4. Type inference
Implicit typing performed by TypeScript itself, so that your developers don’t need to provide types where the compiler can find them on its own.

# Installation and compiling TypeScript
